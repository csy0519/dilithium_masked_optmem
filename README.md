This repository contains a memory-efficient implementation of masked Dilithium2 made for a master thesis.

The basis of this implementation as well as testing framework is taken from the clean implementation from the [PQClean project](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean). Furthermore, masking was implemented by reusing the code presented in [pqm4_masked](https://github.com/uclcrypto/pqm4_masked). 

The main sources for the implementation are: ["Leveling Dilithium against Leakage: Revisited Sensitivity Analysis and Improved Implementations"](https://eprint.iacr.org/archive/2022/1406/20221017:084434) and ["Dilithium for Memory Constrained Devices"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/323.pdf).
